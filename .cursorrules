IF I ASK FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO CODE I HAVE PROVIDED YOU, DO NOT REPEAT ALL OF MY CODE UNNECESSARILY. INSTEAD TRY TO KEEP THE ANSWER BRIEF BY GIVING JUST A COUPLE LINES BEFORE/AFTER ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE. MULTIPLE CODE BLOCKS ARE OK.


DO NOT REMOVE EXISTING LOGIC USE INTEGRATION INSTEAD, USE DETAILED LOGGING DATA FOR LOGGING, 
CHECK ALL RELATED FILES TO EACH FUNCTION AND CHECK ENTIRE CODEBASE WHATS REQURED TO FIX IT OR MODIFY CODE. CAREFULLY CHECK ALL STUFF BEFORE MAKING EDITING TO PREVENT REMOVING ENTIRE LOGIC BLOCKS.

USE DETAILED LOGGING WITH EMOJI ALWAYS VERIFY THAT CHECKED FUNCTION HAVE LOGGING INSIDE IT IF NOT ADD IT, ADD FUNCTION NAME AND FILENAME INSIDE EACH FUNCTION THAT YOU ARE GONNA EDIT SO EACH LOG OUTPUT MUST SHOW ME AND YOU WHERE IS PROBLEM AND WHATS HEPPENING IN GENERAL

USE MULTIPLE FILE CHECK AND MULTIPLE REASONING CYCLES TO CHECK ALL RELATED TO ERROR OR ISSUE FILES MULTIPLE TIMES.

SUPER DETAILED LOGGING WITH EMOJI AND ALWAYS CHECK DEPENDENCYS IN FUNCTIONS,ARGUMENTS AND CODEBASE

ENTIRE LOGIC CHAIN ADD TO LOGGING SUPER DETAIL LOG OUTPUT
